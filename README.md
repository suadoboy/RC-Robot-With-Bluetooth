# RC Robot With Bluetooth

This repository contains the codebase and documentation for building and controlling an RC (Remote Controlled) Robot using Bluetooth technology. The project aims to provide enthusiasts, hobbyists, and developers with a solid foundation to create their own remote-controlled robots that can be controlled wirelessly through a Bluetooth connection. The robot chassis has been designed using 3D printing technology for easy customization.

## Features

- Bluetooth Connectivity: Establish a wireless connection between the RC Robot and a remote control device.
- Remote Control Interface: Intuitive controls for commanding the robot's movements and actions.
- Arduino-Based Implementation: Compatible with Arduino microcontrollers for easy customization.
- Extensible Architecture: Modular design allows for adding or modifying features.
- Example Projects and Tutorials: Step-by-step guides and sample projects for building and programming the robot.
- Community and Support: Collaborate, share ideas, and seek assistance from a vibrant community of RC Robot enthusiasts.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Downloading the 3D Printable Files

To begin, you'll need to download the 3D printable files for the RC Robot chassis. Follow the steps below:

1. Visit the [RC Robot With Bluetooth GitHub repository](https://github.com/suadoboy/RC-Robot-With-Bluetooth).
2. Navigate to the "3D Printed Files" section in resources.
3. Click on the provided link to download the 3D printable files.

### Step 2: 3D Printing the Parts

Now that you have the 3D printable files, it's time to print the parts for the RC Robot chassis. Follow these steps:

1. Prepare your 3D printer by ensuring it is properly calibrated and has the required filament loaded.
2. Open the 3D printable files in your preferred slicing software.
3. Adjust the printing settings according to your printer and filament specifications.
4. Start the printing process and wait for the parts to be fully printed.

### Step 3: Assembling the RC Robot

Once you have all the 3D printed parts, it's time to assemble the RC Robot. Here's what you need to do:

1. Identify each printed part and refer to the provided images for guidance.
2. Follow the assembly instructions in the [Documentation](docs/) section of the repository.
3. Assemble the parts in the correct order, ensuring proper alignment and tight connections.
4. Double-check the connections and make any necessary adjustments.

### Step 4: Configuring the RC Robot

Now that you have the RC Robot fully assembled, it's time to configure it for operation. Follow these steps:

1. Connect your Arduino microcontroller to your computer.
2. Open the Arduino IDE or your preferred Arduino programming environment.
3. Load the provided Arduino sketch from the [Code](code/) directory of the repository.
4. Adjust any necessary configuration parameters in the code, such as Bluetooth settings or motor pin assignments.
5. Upload the code to your Arduino board.
6. Power up the RC Robot and establish a Bluetooth connection with your control device.
